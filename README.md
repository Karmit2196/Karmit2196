### 👋 Welcome to my portfolio!

Hi, I'm **Karmit Lalani**, a **Senior Automation Engineer (SDET)** with over 6 years of experience building scalable, reliable, and future-ready test automation solutions.

I specialize in:
- Building robust **UI and API automation frameworks** using **Cypress** and **Playwright**
- Driving quality across complex **web and mobile ecosystems** (React, Angular, iOS, Android)
- Integrating automated tests seamlessly into **CI/CD pipelines**
- Collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver **bug-resistant, user-ready products**

💡 I'm passionate about enhancing testing through **AI and emerging technologies**, using tools like **Cursor**, **GitHub Copilot**, and **custom AI agents** to:
- Accelerate test development  
- Generate intelligent test data  
- Automate exploratory and regression testing  
- Enhance Cypress/Playwright frameworks through **prompt engineering**

🛠 Outside of testing, I’m a **curious learner** who enjoys building **frontend apps** and exploring the intersection of **AI + DevTools**.

I believe the future of software quality lies at the crossroads of **automation, collaboration, and intelligent systems** — and I’m here for it.
