### ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my portfolio!

Hi, I'm **Karmit Lalani**, a **Senior Automation Engineer (SDET)** with over 6 years of experience building scalable, reliable, and future-ready test automation solutions.

I specialize in:
- Crafting robust **UI and API automation frameworks** using **Cypress** and **Playwright**
- Driving quality across complex **web and mobile applications** (React, Angular, iOS, Android)
- Seamlessly integrating automated tests into **CI/CD pipelines**
- Collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver bug-resistant, user-ready products

ðŸ’¡ Iâ€™m deeply passionate about **leveraging AI in testing** â€” using tools like **Cursor, GitHub Copilot,** and **custom AI agents** to:
- Accelerate test development
- Generate intelligent test data
- Automate exploratory and regression testing
- Enhance existing Cypress/Playwright frameworks through prompt engineering

ðŸ›  Outside of testing, Iâ€™m a curious learner who enjoys building **frontend apps** and exploring the intersection of **AI + DevTools.**

I believe the future of software quality lies at the crossroads of automation, collaboration, and intelligent systems â€” and Iâ€™m here for it.
